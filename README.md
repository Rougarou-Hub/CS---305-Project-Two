CS - 305 Project Two
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial institution seeking to enhance the security of their existing application.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe I did well in testing potential vulnerabilities in my code using static testing. Secure coding is important to protect not only your property but the property of your users. Personal information and trade secret loss can cause great harm to both people and businesses. Coding secure software helps to secure information and overall helps to protect a company’s reputation in the long run.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The dependency check tool was especially helpful, as it streamlined the process of detecting vulnerabilities compared to manually checking each dependency.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Testing showed that most vulnerabilities were caused by outdated libraries, so updating them helps create more secure software. Using penetration testing in the future will help better assess and identify any additional vulnerabilities in the code

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

While coding the software, I continuously ran debug tests to ensure it was functional. After refactoring, I performed another vulnerability scan to check for any new issues that may have been introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Stack overflow, reddit, and many other resoureces proved extremely useful for checking code quality, and figuring out errors that I couldn't solve myself. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

The use of hash function, and proof of security implementations.
